## Description

**LondonGame** is an interactive, text-based adventure game written in Python. The game follows the journey of a character traveling from King's Cross Station to Buckingham Palace. Players must make decisions, overcome challenges, and navigate the city to reach their destination successfully.

This project is my first step into Python programming, combining creativity and coding to create a simple yet engaging experience.
